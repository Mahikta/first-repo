# first-repo
Entirely new to this environment. Hope I will get hands on the same soon.
This is my first project on the github. Myself Mahima and I am a college student.
I know a little bit about programming but not an expert. 
I expect to learn more through this platform. 
Although right now, I am seeking to take part in Hactober 2020 that's why I am here creating my first repository.
Thank you!
